# Ocaml Blog Website

This is a really simple blogging website made in Ocaml (and reasonml).

## Stack(?)

- Ocaml backend
- ReasonML JSX for templating
- Htmx for my "framework"

## Notes

- The code is not pretty but it works. Try the nix flake for easy building.

## Installation

Just use the nix flake command and build!
